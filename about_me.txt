Iâ€™m motivated to learn Node.js because of its ability to build fast, scalable, and efficient server-side applications using JavaScript. Since I already have experience with Python and C, adding Node.js to my skill set will expand my capabilities in backend development, especially for web applications and APIs. Its event-driven, non-blocking architecture makes it ideal for handling real-time data, which aligns with my interest in health informatics and data exchange. Additionally, mastering Node.js will allow me to develop full-stack applications more seamlessly, integrating both frontend and backend using a unified language.
